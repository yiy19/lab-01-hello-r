## Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

In the dataframe datasaurus_dozen are 1846 rows and 3 columns. The variables included are dataset, x, and y. 


### Exercise 2

First let's plot the data in the dino dataset:

```{r plot-dino, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

install.packages("ggplot2")
library("ggplot2")

ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

And next calculate the correlation between `x` and `y` in this dataset:

```{r cor-dino}
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```
The correlation coefficient is -.06447.

### Exercise 3

Add code and narrative as needed.
Note that the R chunks are labelled with `plot-star` and `cor-star` to provide spaces to place the code for plotting and calculating the correlation coefficient.
To finish, clean up the narrative by removing these instructions.

Blah blah blah...

```{r plot-star}

```

I'm some text, you should replace me with more meaningful text...

```{r cor-star}

```

### Exercise 4

Add code and narrative as needed.
Note that two R chunks are given but they are not labeled.
Use the convention from above to name them appropriately.

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

### Exercise 5

Add code and narrative as needed.
To add R chunks either type out the backticks, curly braces, and the letter `r` or use the Insert chunk button above, green C+.
